 Music Folder Organizer

`music_folder_organizer.py` is a Python script designed to organize music files in a specified folder and its subfolders. The script extracts metadata from music files, moves them into a structured directory based on the metadata, and logs the details into a CSV file. It also includes options to delete empty folders after processing.
